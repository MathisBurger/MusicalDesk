# MUI forms

A simple library that can be used to build fast forms with MUI.
Currently this library belongs to the MusicalDesk project. But due to the high potential of reuse in other projects
it will be published as an own NPM package with support for JOY UI as well as MUI itself. At the moment it only supports Joy UI, because
MusicalDesk is built with Joy UI. But for reuseability it would be great if both approaches would be completely supported
